## Note

This feature is here because the default aws-cli feature
(`ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/aws-cli`) is VERY annoying, including telemetry
enabled by default and nudging the user to install Amazon Q (an AWS generative
AI assistant).

If you just want the AWS CLI installed, use this instead.
