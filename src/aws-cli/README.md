# AWS CLI v2 (aws-cli)

Install the AWS CLI v2

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/andreswebs/features/aws-cli:0": {}
}
```

## Options

| Options Id | Description | Type | Default Value |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|


## Note

This feature is here because the default aws-cli feature
(`ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/aws-cli`) is VERY annoying, including telemetry
enabled by default and nudging the user to install Amazon Q (an AWS generative
AI assistant).

If you just want the AWS CLI installed, use this instead.
